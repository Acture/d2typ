# d2typ Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the d2typ codebase. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality Improvements

1. [ ] Complete the unimplemented serialization methods in `src/parser/parsed_data/ser.rs`
	- Replace `todo!()` macros with proper implementations
	- Add tests for each newly implemented method

2. [ ] Replace `unimplemented!()` macros in type conversion implementations
	- In `src/parser/value.rs`, handle all possible YAML and TOML value types
	- Add proper error handling instead of panicking

3. [ ] Improve error handling throughout the codebase
	- Replace generic error messages with more specific ones
	- Add context to errors for better debugging
	- Consider using a custom error type with thiserror crate

4. [ ] Refactor the `parse_input` function in `src/parser/mod.rs`
	- Break down the large match statement into smaller functions
	- Improve readability and maintainability

5. [ ] Add proper documentation comments to all public functions and types
	- Include examples in documentation
	- Document error cases and edge cases

6. [ ] Implement consistent logging throughout the application
	- Add a logging framework (e.g., log + env_logger)
	- Log important operations and potential issues

7. [ ] Improve code organization in `src/parser/mod.rs`
	- Move format detection and parsing logic to separate modules
	- Create a more modular structure

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a plugin system for input formats
	- Create a trait for format parsers
	- Allow external crates to implement new format parsers
	- Make the format detection extensible

2. [ ] Implement a plugin system for output formats
	- Create a trait for format renderers
	- Allow external crates to implement new output formats
	- Support multiple output formats beyond Typst

3. [ ] Refactor the `RenderMode` enum in `src/render.rs`
	- Implement the different rendering modes (Tuple, Dict, Map)
	- Add a command-line option to select the rendering mode

4. [ ] Improve the internal data representation
	- Consider using a more efficient data structure for large datasets
	- Optimize memory usage for large files

5. [ ] Implement streaming processing for large files
	- Avoid loading entire files into memory
	- Process data in chunks where possible

6. [ ] Create a clear separation between parsing, transformation, and rendering
	- Implement a pipeline architecture
	- Allow for custom transformations between parsing and rendering

## Feature Improvements

1. [ ] Add support for more input formats
	- XML
	- INI
	- Protocol Buffers
	- SQLite databases

2. [ ] Add support for more output formats
	- JSON
	- YAML
	- TOML
	- Markdown tables
	- HTML

3. [ ] Implement data transformation capabilities
	- Filtering rows/columns
	- Sorting
	- Aggregation
	- Joining multiple inputs

4. [ ] Add schema validation for input data
	- JSON Schema support
	- Custom validation rules

5. [ ] Implement template support for output
	- Allow custom templates for rendering
	- Support template variables and conditionals

6. [ ] Add support for reading from URLs
	- HTTP/HTTPS sources
	- FTP sources
	- S3 and other cloud storage

7. [ ] Implement caching for repeated operations
	- Cache parsed data for performance
	- Add options to control caching behavior

## Testing Improvements

1. [ ] Increase test coverage
	- Add unit tests for all public functions
	- Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows

2. [ ] Add property-based testing
	- Use proptest or quickcheck for generating test cases
	- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

3. [ ] Implement benchmarking
	- Measure performance of parsing and rendering
	- Compare performance across different input sizes

4. [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
	- Automated testing on pull requests
	- Automated releases

5. [ ] Implement fuzz testing
	- Test with randomly generated inputs
	- Focus on robustness and security

## Documentation Improvements

1. [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation
	- Installation instructions
	- Usage examples for different formats
	- Command-line options reference

2. [ ] Add developer documentation
	- Architecture overview
	- Contribution guidelines
	- Code style guide

3. [ ] Create example projects
	- Show common use cases
	- Provide sample data files

4. [ ] Add inline code examples
	- Show how to use the library programmatically
	- Include examples in README.md

5. [ ] Create a project website
	- Showcase features
	- Provide documentation
	- Include a getting started guide

## Performance Improvements

1. [ ] Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
	- Use a profiling tool to measure performance
	- Focus on the slowest operations

2. [ ] Optimize memory usage
	- Reduce unnecessary cloning
	- Use references where appropriate
	- Consider using Cow<T> for efficient string handling

3. [ ] Implement parallel processing

4. [ ] Optimize string handling
	- Reduce allocations
	- Use string interning for repeated strings

5. [ ] Implement lazy evaluation where appropriate
	- Only compute values when needed
	- Use iterators instead of collecting into vectors
